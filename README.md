# EXPERIMENT 1

EXPERIMENT-1a
Printing “Hello World”


Aim:
1.	Introduction to Output: Uses “using namespace std” to print text to the console, helping beginners understand basic output in C++.

EXPERIMENT 1-b
Printing Sum and Average of 2 numbers

Theory: 

Sum and Average
1.	Basic Arithmetic Operations: Demonstrates how to perform addition and division to calculate the sum and average of numbers.
2.	Input and Output Handling: Teaches how to take input from the user using namespace std and display results.

EXPERIMENT 1-c
Finding whether the number is odd or even

Theory:

Even or Odd
1.	Conditional Statements: Introduces if-else statements to check whether a number is even or odd.
2.	Modulus Operator: Uses the modulus operator % to determine the remainder when a number is divided by 2, crucial for the even or odd check.

EXPERIMENT 1-d
Determining leap years

# EXPERIMENT 2

Data types in C++

Aim: To understand and implement the different data types in C++ 

Theory:

Data Types, I/O Operations
Integer Types
1.	int: Stores standard whole numbers.
2.	short int: Stores smaller whole numbers.
3.	long int: Stores larger whole numbers.
4.	long long int: Stores very large whole numbers.
Floating-Point Types
1.	float: Stores single precision decimal numbers.
2.	double: Stores double precision decimal numbers.
3.	long double: Stores extended precision decimal numbers.
Unsigned Types
•	unsigned int: Stores non-negative whole numbers with an extended range.
•	unsigned types can only represent non-negative numbers

wchar_t
•	Purpose: Designed to represent characters from larger character sets, including international or Unicode characters.
•	Size: Typically 2 or 4 bytes (depends on the system and compiler).

Operators in C++

Aim: to understand the different operators such as arithmetic, logical , BITWISE etc

Theory:

•	This C++ program demonstrates fundamental operations on integer variables, including arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operations.

•	Initially, variables a, b, c, d, and e are assigned values, and a series of arithmetic operations are performed on them, such as addition (a += 55), increment (a++), division (b /= 10), multiplication (c *= 15), subtraction (d -= 20), modulus (e %= 24), and decrement (e--). The program then uses comparison operations to check and print if a is greater than b and if d equals zero.

# EXPERIMENT-4

Bitwise Operators in C++

Aim: Implementing the BITWISE operators like AND, NAND, XOR on 2 numbers

Theory:
•	It demonstrates bitwise operations, including AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, and prints the results. The final values of the variables are also printed. This program highlights basic C++ syntax and operations.¬¬¬
